# Shape Pinball

*by Christian Bruccoleri*

## Ideas to Implement


### Features

- UI
	- health, energy, score
	- Game Over and Restart


- Wanderers should have some sense of purpose (basic AI): e.g. seek energy sources

- Objects that are being hit should generate energy "pills". These are attracted by the blackhole only.

- Add sound effects

- Add music

- [DONE] Wanderers are attracted by the black hole, but do not fall in

- [DONE] Visualize Vector field.

- [DONE] Each object attracts or repels with a small force.


### Visual and Art

- Shader for Black Hole swirling effect

- Show mouse clicks with a ripple, like waves in waters that quickly fade

- Animations for coming to life and dying


### Bugs

- Fix particles system: emitting cone on +Z axis (3d)
